# Pancake Themer

## Overview

This tool provides an interactive way to generate custom frontend CSS for installations of [Pancake](http://pancakeapp.com).
Only some basic functions are currently available, mainly for changing fonts, sizes, and colors.

## Usage

To use, open this page: http://aepex.github.io/pancake-themer/

The left side shows a preview of your current settings, and the right side contains a list of all the page parts that are editable.
After going through each part and making the edits you want, click the Get CSS button at the top.

A box will appear containing your custom CSS, simply copy and paste the code into the Branding > Frontend CSS box inside of Pancake, and click Save.

## Limitations

This hasn't been tested much, so use at your own risk! I highly recommend previewing your own invoices afterward to make sure everything looks right.
If something goes awry, erasing all the code from the Frontend CSS box will set things back to how they were.

## Credits

This tool is largely based on the [Live CSS Editor](https://github.com/rukavina/live-css-editor) by [rukavina](https://github.com/rukavina).
